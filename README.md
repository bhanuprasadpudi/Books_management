Book Management System:


Overview: 
Here’s a concise overview of the provided Python code for the book management system:
.The code creates a menu-driven interface for managing a list of books.
.Users can add, list, mark as read, find, update, and delete books.
.Book data is stored in dictionaries with keys for name, author, and read status.
.Overall, it’s a simple tool for organizing and tracking books.


Description:
.The code implements a basic book management system that allows users to interact with a list of books.
.Users can perform various actions related to books, such as adding new books, listing existing books, marking books as read, finding specific books, updating book details, and deleting books.


Functionality:

=>Menu Function (menu()):
	.The menu() function initializes a list of books (presumably empty) and then enters a loop.
	.Inside the loop, it prompts the user for input using the USER_CHOICE string.
	.Depending on the user’s choice, it calls various other functions:
		.'a': Calls prompt_add_book() to add a new book.
		.'l': Calls prompt_list_book() to list all books.
		.'r': Calls prompt_read_book() to mark a book as read.
		.'d': Calls prompt_delete_book() to delete a book.
		.'f': Calls prompt_find_book() to find a book.
		.'u': Calls prompt_update_book() to update a book.
		.'q': Exits the loop and ends the program.
	.The user can keep interacting with the menu until they choose to quit.
=>Prompt Functions:
	.Each prompt function (prompt_add_book(), prompt_list_book(), etc.) handles a specific action based on user input.
	.For example:
		.prompt_add_book(): Asks the user for the name and author of a book and inserts it into the book list.
		.prompt_list_book(): Lists all the books along with their read status.
		.prompt_read_book(): Marks a book as read.
		.prompt_find_book(): Searches for a book by name.
		.prompt_update_book(): Updates the name and author of a book.
		.prompt_delete_book(): Deletes a book from the list.
=>Book List and Helper Functions:
	.The create_book_list(), get_all_books(), insert_book(), mark_book_read(), find_book(), update_book(), and delete_books() functions are part of the book management system.
	.They manage the book data (name, author, and read status) and perform various operations on it.
	.For example:
		.create_book_list(): Placeholder function (currently does nothing).
		.get_all_books(): Returns the list of all books.
		.insert_book(name, author): Adds a new book to the list.
		.mark_book_read(name): Marks a book as read.
		.find_book(name): Searches for a book by name and prints its details.
		.update_book(name, new_name, author_change): Updates the name and author of a book.
		.delete_books(name): Removes a book from the list.
=>Implementation Details:
	.The code defines several functions (prompt_add_book(), prompt_list_book(), etc.) to handle specific tasks.
	.It maintains a list of books, each represented as a dictionary with keys for name, author, and read status.
	.The menu() function serves as the main entry point, repeatedly prompting the user for input until they choose to quit.
=>User Interaction:
	.Users run the program and interact with the menu options to manage their book collection.
	.They can add, list, mark as read, find, update, and delete books based on their preferences.

Conclusion:
The Python code creates a basic book management system. Users can interact with the system through a menu-driven interface to perform actions like adding books, listing existing books, marking books as read, finding specific books, updating book details, and deleting books. The code organizes book data in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with keys for name, author, and read status.
